################## Coro patient prediction 2.0__in_Denmark__ ##################

# The prediction is achieved by applying the Geometric series, along with a 
# recrusive algorithm. In this case, each person who get infected by this virus,
# will go through a 8 days period (T_period):(referred by thesis in 'Lancet')
#                                 3 days generate virus inside their body (T_delay)
#                                 5 days spread to other people (T_infect)
# Then after this 8-days period, this patient will go to hospital and no longer
# be a infection source.

# Assumption: [1]. You might meet ['nr_people_meet_a_day'] diffreent people in a day.
#             [2]. You have ['percent_close_talking'*100%] talk to them closely.
#             [3]. During those closely talk, you have ['percent_infect'*100%] infect them.
#             [4]. Values assumed above is in line 40-43, and of course you can 
#                  tune them to see how these values influence the final prediction.
# Anyway, you will see how sensitive this final prediction when you tune these hyparameters
